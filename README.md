# Deep-learning

This project applies deep learning techniques, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN), in two areas:

Part 1 - Electronics and Telecommunication: A neural network was developed to predict signal strength for a communications equipment manufacturing company after performing extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), addressing missing values, and handling imbalanced data. The initial model achieved 61% accuracy, which was improved using techniques like Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Kernel Initializer.

Part 2 - Street View House Number Recognition: A neural network with three hidden layers was implemented to recognize house numbers from Google Street View images, enabling accurate address localization. The model achieved an accuracy of 81%.
